<h2>Technical</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
Below is a summary of the technical setup.
</p>
<p>
GPS data is sampled using a standard <a target="_top" href="http://www.delorme.com/bluelogger">Bluetooth GPS module</a>.
This module communicates with a mobile phone, a
<a target="_top" href="http://www.nokia.com/nokia/0,4879,33210,00.html">Nokia 6600</a>.
The mobile phone runs a <a target="_top" href="http://java.sun.com/j2me">Java (J2ME)</a>
program that reads GPS
data from the GPS module and sends it through the mobile
data network (GPRS) to the geoskating.com server. The skater can enter
the road quality as a number (1-5) on the phone keypad.
The current quality is always added to each GPS sample sent to the server.

</p>
<p>
On the server the (enriched) GPS samples are received and
assembled. A map-drawing program on the server
reads the route files and generates maps that can be viewed
(and later printed) through <a href="http://www.geoskating.com">www.geoskating.com</a>.
</p>
<h3>Multimedia Annotation</h3>
<p>
During skating the skater can make various kinds of <b><i>media</i></b>, i.e. pictures, movies, sounds, texts through
the mobile phone or for example using a regular digital camera (I use a <a target="_top" href="http://www.canon.co.jp/Imaging/IXUS/IXUS.html">Canon Digital Ixus</a>). Media
items can be sent to the server e.g. by email (or later directly) from the phone, or by upload from a browser. On the
server these media items are coupled to the GPS locations
where they were captured. This is realized by correlating the item's timestamp to GPS timestamps. For example,
picture files from a digital camera have an embedded timestamp (e.g. JPEG EXIF). In other cases
the origin date from e.g. an email is used.
</p>
<p>
The media items form a <b><i>multimedial annotation layer</i></b> over the route maps.
</p>
<h3>Live Position Tracking</h3>
<p>
In addition, live position data of skaters is pushed to the browser such that
they can be seen moving in near real-time over the map.
</p>
<h3>Server Technology</h3>
<p>
<a target="_new" href="http://www.keyworx.org"><img src="img/kw-logo.gif" border="0" hspace="5" alt="kw-logo" align="left" /></a>
The Open Source <a target="_top" href="http://www.keyworx.org">KeyWorx</a> platform is used as the main
application framework for the (Tomcat) server, providing portal functionality,
(multimedia) content management and many other services. KeyWorx is under development at <a target="_top" href="http://www.waag.org">Waag Society</a>.
</p>
<p>
<a target="_new" href="http://www.pushlets.com"><img src="img/pushlet-logo.gif" border="0" hspace="5" alt="pushlet-logo" align="right" /></a>
Real-time networking (phone to server and server to browser) is currently
done using <a target="_top" href="http://www.pushlets.com">Pushlets</a>.
Pushlets provide a lightweight (<a target="_top" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX">AJAX-like</a>) publish/subscribe framework over HTTP.
</p>
<p>
The server software runs on
<a target="_top" href="http://www.debian.org">Debian GNU Linux</a> with the standard <a target="_top" href="http://httpd.apache.org">Apache web server</a>
coupled to the <a target="_top" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/tomcat">Apache Tomcat</a> Java application server.
</p>

<h3>Beyond GeoSkating</h3>
<p>
During the project and inspired by
the many emails received, I
have realized that the generic concept behind GeoSkating
has much wider applicability in other domains like
sports (hiking, cycling, climbing etc),
travelling, gaming and even partying.
This technology can be
used for any kind of personal geographic mapping of
locations, annotations and media. There are also
hooks for location-based feedback to the phone, more popularly known as LBS
(Location-Based Services).
