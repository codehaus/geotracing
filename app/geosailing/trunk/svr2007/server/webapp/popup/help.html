	<h2>How to Navigate the Map</h2>
	<hr/>

	<p>
		What you see is projected on a <a target="_new" href="http://www.google.com/apis/maps">Google Map</a>.<br/>
	</p>

	<h3>Zoom In/Out</h3>

	<p>
		Use the + and - icons in the upper left or the slider. Note that not all maps may support
		very detailed zoom levels at all places in the world. Double clicking anywhere on the map also zooms
		and centers the map.
	</p>

	<h3>Moving (Panning)</h3>

	<p>
		You can move (pan) the map by using the arrow icons in the upper left, but far
		easier is to drag the map with your mouse.
	</p>

	<h3>Centering</h3>

	<p>
		Double-clicking anywhere on the map centers and zooms the map
		at that point.
	</p>

	<h3>Selecting Maps</h3>

	<p>
		Choose a different map as background by using the options under the "Map" menu.
		Some map-types may contain specific data/features like GPS-trace points.
