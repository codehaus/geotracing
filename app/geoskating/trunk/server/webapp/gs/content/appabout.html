<h2>About GeoSkating</h2>
<hr/>
<p>
GeoSkating automates the creation of
interactive, <strong>multimedial skate-maps</strong> by using the
Global Positioning System (GPS), Mobile Phones and the Internet.
While skating,
GPS position data is published directly to a server through
a mobile phone.
At the same time the skater can enrich GPS data
with road surface ratings and by sending pictures and videos from the phone.
The server will draw geographic maps
showing road quality through colouring (red=bad, orange=soso, yellow=good, green=excellent, gray=unknown). Pictures and videos
are presented on the GPS locations where they were captured (geotagged).
Even more, skaters can also be followed
<b><i>in real-time over the map</i></b> while skating!

<h2>Motivation</h2>
<p>
Key questions for long-distance inline skaters are: <b><i>Where can I skate</i></b> and
<b><i>How is the road quality ?</i></b>
Common geographic maps do not show details like
<b><i>asphalt quality</i></b>.
</p>
<p>
Being a long-distance skater I have been making routes on
<a target="_top" href="http://www.skeeler.org">www.skeeler.org</a> but
found these hard to maintain and actualize.
</p>
<p>
Doing <a target="_new" href="http://www.justobjects.org/blog/index.php?p=8">projects
using GPS combined with
Mobile Phones</a>, and inspired by the <a target="_new" href="http://realtime.waag.org">Amsterdam Realtime</a> project
I got the idea to draw routes automatically
while skating.
</p>
<h2>Is this new ?</h2>
<p>
Of course with a handheld GPS you can capture route
data and dump it in a program that draws tracks on a map. But GeoSkating
goes further: while skating you can enter the road quality
on your mobile phone, such that you have <b><i>enriched GPS data</i></b>.
When the map is generated the qualities are translated into
colors on the map. Furthermore, as more people participate in
GeoSkating, the routes will arise as fast as they skate.
</p>
<p>
Even more enrichments are available
such as submitting media items like photo's, videos or spoken audio.
This data will be used to generate <b><i>multimedial annotated maps</i></b>.
</p>
<h2>Technology</h2>
The GeoSkating application is realized
with <a target="_top" href="http://www.geotracing.com">GeoTracing</a>, a generic mapping/tracing
application framework.
