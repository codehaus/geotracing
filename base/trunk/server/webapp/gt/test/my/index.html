<h2>Minty Fresh Flavor!</h2>

<p>
	And so it has happened, as was foretold; I have broken down and created a source-ordered
	version of <a href="../skidoo/">skidoo</a>. This layout has the middle column appearing
	first in the source.
</p>

<p>
	I started with a copy of the <a href="../skidoo/lean/">skidoo lean</a> stylesheet and
	cleaned it up considerably. I broke the stylesheet down into sections with a brief
	description of each. I've also added new comments to <a href="skidoo_too.css">this
	stylesheet</a> to try and better explain what's happening. But I'm still keeping everything
	within a single stylesheet, much like <a href="../skidoo/lean/">skidoo lean</a>. Is it
	the best of <a href="../skidoo/">both</a> <a href="../skidoo/lean/">worlds</a>? Maybe.

</p>

<h2>Why Care About Source Ordering?</h2>

<p>
	You don't have to. You really don't. But, it's worthing considering.
</p>

<p>
	There's a couple of reasons to care. The first is that some search engines
	will only read X number of bytes into your page before it stops and indexes
	whatever it got up to that point. If you're left and/or right columns come
	first in the source, and they're incredibly long, the search engine may have
	only indexed your side column(s) and never got to the meat of the page,
	the middle column.
</p>

<p>
	The second reason is that browsers which do not support CSS will not see your
	page in a columned fashion. This means the content is presented in order
	of what comes first in the source. So each page a user visits will give them
	your navigation elements and whatever other stuff you've got in your side
	columns. With the middle column appearing first in your layout's source, the
	users of these browsers will get right to the meat of your page without
	having to search for it. The downside is that there may be important navigational
	elements in your side column(s) that you want to appear first. A way around this
	would be to add a link at the top of the page that links to an anchor within
	the page that's placed at the start of this important area. The link could say
	something like "jump down to site navigation" or whatever you want. You can
	hide this link using CSS so only non-CSS browsers will see it. Keep in mind
	that if you implement a horizontal menu, as I've done on this page, that will
	appear before the content as well. So perhaps the really important navigational
	elements go there, and then you don't have to worry about this.
	This is something you may want to think a bit about before deciding what to do.
</p>

<p>

	The third reason is Mac IE. I'm still trying to figure this one out but it seems
	the negative-margin trick used to create the three-column layout in
	<a href="../skidoo/">skidoo</a> causes an issue with Mac IE's ability to select
	within the three columns. It seems that selecting text within the first
	element to come in the source of the document is... easier(?) than those
	that follow in the source. So putting the middle column first means selecting
	text from that column (should) be easier for Mac IE users (using Skidoo). Perhaps
	I can find a workaround and this third reason won't apply anymore, but for now,
	that's one of the reasons why I'm doing this.
</p>

<h2>Markup/CSS Changes</h2>

<p>
	Minor changes were needed in both the HTML and CSS to get the source-ordered
	version working. Essentially I had to wrap the left and middle columns in
	a new <code>div</code> block and float that left. Inside this new
	<code>#SOWrap div</code> element I've right-floated the middle column,
	and then, just like in <a href="../skidoo/">skidoo</a> I left-float
	the left column and use a negative margin to push it left. The right
	column pretty much stays where it always has been.

</p>

<p>
	On the CSS side of things I had to make the obvious float changes and I
	also had to move the right-side 1px margin, normally applied to
	<code>#middleColumn</code>, to the new <code>#SOWrap</code> element,
	since it's that element which touches with the left-edge of the
	right column.
</p>

<h2>About The Demos</h2>

<p>
	There are some demos that are linked to in the left-hand column.
	Each demo uses the <a href="skidoo_too.css">standard Skidoo Too stylesheet</a>.
	The mods are created through embedded stylesheets which you can view by
	simply viewing the source of the demos.

</p>

<p>
	In a real-world environment, you would not want to use embedded stylesheets.
	I'm using them because it makes the changes needed to achieve the effects seen in
	the mods very obvious and easy to focus on. What you should actually do is either
	put the embedded stylesheet in a separate CSS file and link to it with a
	<code>link</code> tag or modify a copy of the <a href="skidoo_too.css">standard Skidoo Too stylesheet</a>
	with the changes indicated in the embedded stylesheet. The latter, if nothing else, is a nice
	exercise in getting down and dirty with my style of authoring CSS. This way things might not feel
	so foreign later on when you want to make your own mods.
</p>

<p>
	I know I ought to be more consistent with my documentation. It's incredibly thick in some
	areas, and incredibly thin in others, such as my lack of documentation on what the mods are/do/etc.
	If you've got any burning questions just give toss me an <a href="mailto:ruthsarian@gmail.com">e-mail</a>

	and I'll answer them.
</p>

<h2>Anything Else</h2>

<p>
	Nope. If you're familiar with <a href="../skidoo/">skidoo</a> or
	<a href="../skidoo/lean/">skidoo lean</a> then the rest has
	already been covered.
