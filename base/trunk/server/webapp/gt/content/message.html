	<h2>New Version MobiTracer</h2>
	<hr/>

	<p>
As of march 26, 2007 there is a new version (3.6.0) of the MobiTracer mobile client. If you have
		an older version, that may still work for making tracks but media uploads (photos/text/audio)
		will fail. Please <a href="my" target="_new">login </a> and install the latest version using the instructions
		provided under [mobitracer] once logged in.
	</p>

	<p>
	Sorry for the inconvenience.
		 Email me if you still experience problems at: just AT justobjects.nl (replace AT with @).
