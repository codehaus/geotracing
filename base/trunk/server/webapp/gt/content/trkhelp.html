	<h3>Live and Archive Mode</h3>

	<p>
		The map is always in one of two modes, Live or View (Archive) mode. Default is View mode.
	</p>

	<p>
		Select "Show|Live/Active Users (Skaters)" to put the map into "live-mode".
		In this mode real-time data of users moving over the map is displayed (if there are
		active users). Otherwise their icons are displayed at their last known location.
		A live user is shown by a blinking icon. Some user icons may be outside the area in view.
		You can zoom to and view the actual/current track of a user
		by selecting a user from the drop-down box.
	</p>

	<p>
		Any other option under "Show" puts the map into the View mode. In this mode
		track-and related data can be viewed on the map. If any live events occur this is signaled ("... is live")
		in the top-bar. You may then decide to switch to live mode.
	</p>

	<p>
		When in live mode select a user to center the map at his/her location.
	</p>

	<h3>Viewing Tracks</h3>

	<p>Select "Show|Tracks". Then select a user and a track from
		the dropdown boxes.<br/>The Track should be drawn on the map.
		Each track has a window that displays
		the media, POIs and track info. You can open multiple windows. Clicking
		on a window takes you to the last point in the track.
	</p>

	<p>The small square boxes on the map are media. Move your mouse over them (no need to click) to see media in
		the user/track windows.<br/>
		Clicking on an image will enlarge to image to actual size.

	<h3>Viewing Features</h3>

	<p>Selecting "Show|Media/POIs in Area" shows media/POIs (a.k.a features) of the map area in view. Since there are
		potentially many
		media in the archive a random selection is made. "Show|Media/POIs" shows random features from the archive
		not necessarily in the current area.
	</p>

	<p>You can play back the media/POIs using the control buttons below the preview window. the map will center
		at a selected feature.

		under "Show".</p>
