DOCUMENTATION FOR get.jsp
$Id: get-usage.txt,v 1.2 2006-08-28 09:43:23 just Exp $

get.jsp provides REST services to query data from a GeoTracing app.
The type/structure/amount of the result returned is determined by the
query params in particular the "cmd" parameter.

GeoTracing applications can optionally extend get.jsp
with application-specific queries/information requests by implementing these in
the file myget.jsp. this file is included in get.jsp and should implement doMyCommand().
If the application handles/overrides a command doMyCommand() should return an XML result.
Otherwise null should be returned and the command will be handled in get.jsp (doCommand()).

When developing with get.jsp, it is most optimal to use an XML-aware browser like Moz/FF
that can display the results as formatted XML.

NOTE
Not all queries are yet optimized!!

URL
The get.jsp URL is located at the <webapp>/srv/get.jsp
where <webapp> is the name of the GeoTracing web application.
For example the webapp bliin01 has the
URL http://test.bliin.com/bliin01/srv/get.jsp

URL STRUCTURE
Each get.jsp request must have the following form:

get.jsp?cmd=<command>&<command-specific-parameters>

Examples:
get.jsp?cmd=q-tracks-by-user&user=caglar
get.jsp?cmd=q-active-tracks
get.jsp?cmd=get-track&id=123456&format=gtx

The parameter "cmd" must alwalys be present (otherwise this
file is returned.

Two types of "cmd" parameters are used:
- query commands: "cmd" starts with "q-" (e.g. cmd=q-active-tracks)
- any other commands: no specific convention (e.g. cmd=get-track)

Query commands always return a common XML structure as follows:

<query-store-rsp cnt="(record count)" >
   <record>
     <id>23045</id>
     <name>M13</name>
     <lon>4.9005367</lon>
     <lat>52.3689717</lat>
     <loginname>green</loginname>
   </record>
   <record>
     <id>177563</id>
     <name>KillerClub</name>
     <lon>4.8997617</lon>
     <lat>52.3721767</lat>
     <loginname>janb</loginname>
   </record>
     .
     .
</query-store-rsp>

The field names for each <record/> are specific for each query command.
