<h2>About</h2>
<p>
The MobiTracer is the mobile phone application. It connects to both a Bluetooth GPS receiver
and the GeoTracing server. When running, MobiTracer will read GPS location data and
sends these to the server. In addition, while tracing you can issue various commands
to manage your tracklog data and make annotations (POIs/media).
Users that are trying out MobiTracer can find more specific notes
<a href="http://www.geotracing.com/wiki/index.php?title=GeoTracing:Apps:MobiTracer">in this document</a>.
</p>
<h2>Getting MobiTracer</h2>
<p>
Go to <a href="http://www.geotracing.com/gt">www.geotracing.com/gt</a> and select "My|Login".
</p>
<h2>Screenshots</h2>

<p>
This shows the main screen. The left top label show the status of your GPS. The right top label shows the network
status (sending GPS locations or paused).
The middle shows various GPS or track info. At the bottom is a single
button to issue various commands (see below).
</p>

</p>
<p>
On the MapScreen you can view your location on a Google Map.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
MobiTracer is installed Over The Air (OTA), i.e. through a URL from your mobile phone.
</p>
<h2>Compatibility</h2>
<p>
Your phone needs to at least support J2ME MIDP2.0 with the
Java Bluetooth API
(JSR-82).
	See also <a href="http://www.j2mepolish.org/devices/devices-btapi.html">this list of JSR-82 phones</a> and
	optionally the J2ME MultiMedia API.
</p>

<h2>Manual</h2>
<p>
Below a short manual for those experimenting with MobiTracer.
There is just one button at the bottom of the screen. The content
of that button can be changed through the joystick on your phone.
Firing the joystick issues the specific command. Below are the commands.
Basically you are managing tracklogs that are kept on the server.
</p>
<p>
<ul>
  <li>NewTrack - create a new track</li>
  <li>Suspend Track - pause sending GPS data to server (on startup GPS sending is paused)</li>
   <li>Resume Track - resume sending GPS data to server</li>
    <li>Add POI - add a point of interest</li>
  <li>Send Photo - make a photo and add it to track (server will geotag location)</li>
   <li>Send Audio - make audio recording add it to track (server will geotag location)</li>
    <li>Sound Off - toggle beeps made when GPS samples are read and send to server</li>
  <li>Hide GPS Info - hide/show detailed GPS information on screen</li>
  <li>Lock Keyboard - lock the apps keys to prevent unwanted commands (unlock with #5)</li>
  <li>View Log - view the log messages (for troubleshooting)</li>
   <li>SelectGPS - find and pair your Bluetooth GPS to the phone</li>
    <li>Keys 1 through 5 -  set the "RoadRating" e.g. asphalt rating (1=worst, 5=best)</li>
   <li>Show Map - view your location on a (Google) map (experimental)</li>
 <li>Quit - exit MobiTracer app</li>
 </ul>
</p>

<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
On first startup you need to pair your GPS. Issue the command "SelectGPS". Follow the
directions on the form and exit MobiTracer. Start MobiTracer again and verify that
the GPS connects ("connected" under GPS label) and that
you get GPS data and
can connect to the server.
</p>
<p>
On first start you need to create a track through the "New Track" command. From then on all
GPS data, POIs and media are coupled to that track. MobiTracer always operates on a single track being your
active track. Creating a new track always will archive the current track.

</p>
<p>
Note that GPS sending is by default paused. To start sending issue the command "Resume Track". Likewise
to pause sending (e.g. when taking a break) issue "Suspend Track". Basically you are creating
"track-segments" within your track.
</p>
<p>
Beeps: a low beep indicates a GPS-location is read. A high beep indicates that a GPS-location is sent
to the server. If this annoys you, toggle sound with the command "Sound On/Off".
I usually lock the keyboard (command "Lock Keyboard") and put the phone in my pocket.
hearing the beeps indicates all is well and working.
</p>
<p>
Road rating: use the numeric keys 1-5 to set the road-rating for the current track. Default is -1 (no rating).
While going the current rating is remembered and added to each sample sent to the server.
Ratings may later be visualized with colours on the website.
</p>
<p>
Sending media: within MobiTracer the commands "Send Photo" and "Send Audio" can be used to
send media directly from within the application. The photo's are low-res currently.
In addition you can send media through email (as attachments), either from
your phone or any other means. In particular you can make .3gp movies on your phone
and send them by email from the gallery. Your phone's email address needs to be known on the server
as part of your subscription.
I use a digital camera (Canon Ixus) and send photo's later. By timestamping
your photo gets geotagged. For .3gp movies the time of email sending is used, so in that case
you will have to send in immediately.
</p>
<p>
GPS info: important values for the precision are the number of satellites used ("used"), should be 5 or more and
the "hdop" values (should be about less than 2 or 3).
</p>
<h2>Viewing Your Tracks</h2>
<p>
View them at <a href="http://www.geotracing.com/gt">www.geotracing.com/gt</a>, the TraceLand page.
Use the menu to show live or archived tracks (Show). You can change the background map with Map menu.
</p>
<h2>It doesn't work !</h2>
<p>
Yes this MobiTracer is experimental and under constant development. There's a wealth
of mobile phone types, GPS types and provider-specific issues.
